This sample website shows how you can start the OAuth login flow into a WebDirect file, right from your own web site.
Without taking the user to the WebDirect launch center or the WebDirect file's login screen.

This version is when the website itself runs through FileMaker Server's web server.  all references in the code are local to the FileMaker Server machine.
If you have a web site that runs on another server, see this repo: <TBD>

See this blog post for how it works:
<TBD>

This functionality already exists for logging in with regular FileMaker accounts, see this resource:

Enjoy!

A simple (gradient-heavy) single pager that revisits a style I messed with on two
previous designs (Tessellate and Telephasic). Fully responsive, built on Sass,
and, as usual, loaded with an assortment of pre-styled elements. Have fun! :)
